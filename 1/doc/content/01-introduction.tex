"Let there be light", he said, and through lines of Assembly code the LED lights started to flicker at one hertz each. The task at hand was to write assembly code, which would be flashed onto the flash memory on the microcontroller unit.

Manipulating the Assembly code is consisting of changing values at a specific register in order to turn on lights. The code may also be manipulated and changed based on input from a specific gamedpad supplied for the task. The gamepad includes eight buttons and the same amount of LED lights which is used for both the inputs and also the outputs in this exercise.

The exercise only specified that we should learn startup code for ARM processors and how to program GPIO. This would be used to detect button presses on the gamepad and to turn on or off LED lights. Since we did not get any other tasks for this exercise, we decided to get creative and write an Assembly code which would accept a specific sequence of inputs and blink all the lights if done correctly. Until this has happened every odd-numbered light has an on state and every even-numbered light has an off state, and every second all lights are flipped to the other state.
