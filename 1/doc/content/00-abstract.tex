When a button is pressed, a light is turned on. For this to happen there needs to be somthing that can observe that press and realize that a light is supposed to turn on. What in reality is happening is a program observes the press and signals the light. This report is going to focus about how to go create a program capable of such actions using a custom-made gamepad and a EFM32GG-DK3750 Development Kit, with an in-depth look at the parts used. With several tries we understood how the lights changes and found a new goal. When testing different strategies to get to the new goal, we realised that there was a different energy effiency based on different methods used. This lead us to testing what would increase the energy effiency and still be able to solve the task given to us. All code written was written in Assembly.
