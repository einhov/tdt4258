When a button is pressed, a light is turned on. For this to happen there needs
to be somthing that can observe that press and realize that a light is supposed
to turn on. What in reality is happening is a program observes the press and
signals the light. This report is going to focus on how to go create a program
capable of such actions using a custom-made gamepad and an EFM32GG-DK3750
Development Kit, with an in-depth look at the parts used. As we learned how we
could use buttons to control the lights we found a new goal. When testing
different strategies to get to the new goal, we realised that different methods
resulted in different levels of energy consumption. This lead us to testing
what would increase the energy effiency and still be able to solve the task
given to us. All code written was written in ARM Assembly.
