\chapter{Conclusion}

To conclude, we've gained experience writing software for a Linux system, both
user applications targetting the POSIX API and software for the kernel, in the
form of a kernel module. Writing an application for the system on bare metal and
for a managed system, such as the Linux system we employed, differ quite a bit
in their methods. Writing for the Linux system abstracts the hardware behind a
portable and helpful API, while also complicating some tasks that might be
simpler to perform on bare metal. However, that price is probably fine when the
tradeoff is access to the abstractions it provides. Many user applications can
be developped faster for this abstraction layer than for bare metal, and be
written far more portable.
