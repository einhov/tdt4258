\section{Correctness}

Our game correctly reads input from the gamepad driver and draws correctly to
the frambebuffer. Small artifacts are noticable in the animated blitted
balloons.

\section{Energy Efficiency}

Energy consumption data is summarized in the following tables. It is obvious
that compiling the Linux kernel with tickless idle considerably lowers the
energy consumption, even during animated sequences. The listed energy
consumptions for the ending animation is the average consumption \emph{after}
the entire balloon has entered the display. The energy consumption is lower with
the balloon partially outside the display, which makes it obvious that the
effect is quite power hungry, at least as it is implemented in our game.
