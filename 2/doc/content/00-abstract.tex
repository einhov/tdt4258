Motivation:
Today, sound is something generated by billions of digital devices around the world.
The importance of a digital to analogue converter(DAC) is something people take for granted. This report is motivated to give the reader a better understanding of a very important and complex subject of the digital world, namely the process of generating digital information to analogue signals. A small process that has great importance for the daily communication between people across the globe. 

Problem statement:
How can we make different sound effects when some different gamepad-buttons are pressed? How low can we push the energy efficiency of such a process?
During this report we will take a deep dive into the world of software and hardware communication, and see how these technologies combined can create sound for the human ear.

Approach:
The problem statement above are solved with a low-level programming language called C. This C program will run directly on a EFM32 development board without support of an operating system and which plays different sound effects when different buttons are pressed. We will also provide pictures from the energy measurements shown by a LCD screen attached on the board.

Results:
We came to several interesting results, both in interaction with buttons that generates one or more sounds and impressive energy efficient outcomes. These results will certainly open the avid readers eyes of an otherwise general incomprehensible and complex world.
