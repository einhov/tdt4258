\chapter{Conclusion}

For this exercise, we were tasked with writing a program in C code, which would
respond with sound when a button on the gamepad was pressed. The program was
compiled using GCC, linked using a specified linker script, changed into binary
files and finally transferred to the memory of the supplied EFM32GG. We already
had experience with this, which made the task familiar. That is, however, not
necessarily a good thing, and the task at hand still became challenging. A task
which proved difficult was to have the program run fast enough to fulfill our
requirements and wishes. This made us change what we initially wanted and
decided that we had to sacrifice optimality in order for the program to run fast
enough for our tastes.

What we understood is that even if we managed to play sounds from the EFM32GG,
it still is difficult balancing quality and resources. We saw that we
had to sacrifice optimality in one of them in order to have the other one at an
acceptable level. This means that even if we have completed the assigned task,
we didn't perfect it.
